# WebWOz Persistent Storage Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Template Persistence**
- Templates are automatically saved to `DATA_DIR/templates.json` when created or updated
- Templates are loaded on server startup
- Atomic file operations (temp file → rename) prevent corruption
- Thread-safe operations with locks

### 2. **Automatic Conversation Persistence**
- Every message is automatically saved to disk immediately after being sent
- Conversations stored in `DATA_DIR/conversations/{room_id}.json`
- Each conversation file includes metadata (timestamps, message count)
- Thread-safe operations with locks
- Automatic loading of existing conversations on server startup

### 3. **Enhanced Storage Structure**
```
backend/data/
├── templates.json              # All templates with categories
└── conversations/              # Individual conversation files
    ├── abc12345.json          # Conversation for room abc12345
    ├── def67890.json          # Conversation for room def67890
    └── ...
```

### 4. **New API Endpoints for Data Management**
- `GET /api/conversations` - List all conversations with metadata
- `GET /api/conversations/{room_id}` - Get specific conversation
- `GET /api/conversations/{room_id}/export` - Download as JSON file
- `DELETE /api/conversations/{room_id}` - Delete conversation
- `GET /api/conversations/stats` - Storage statistics
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with storage status

### 5. **Environment Configuration for Render**
- `DATA_DIR` environment variable for custom storage location
- Defaults to `backend/data/` for development
- Production recommendation: `/opt/render/project/src/data`

### 6. **Recovery and Reliability Features**
- Conversations automatically reload from disk on server restart
- Atomic file operations prevent data corruption
- Error handling and logging for all storage operations
- Unique room ID generation (checks both memory and disk)

## 🚀 Benefits for Your User Study

### **No Manual Export Required**
- All conversations are automatically saved as they happen
- No need to manually click export buttons
- Zero data loss risk

### **Persistent Across Deployments**
- Server restarts don't lose data
- Render deployments maintain conversation history
- Template changes persist automatically

### **Easy Data Access**
- API endpoints for programmatic access to all conversations
- Individual conversation export for analysis
- Bulk statistics for study overview

### **Monitoring and Management**
- Health endpoint shows storage status
- Statistics API for monitoring study progress
- Individual conversation deletion if needed

## 🔧 Render Deployment Configuration

Set these environment variables in your Render service:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
NODE_ENV=production
DATA_DIR=/opt/render/project/src/data
```

## 📊 Testing Results

✅ **Storage Creation**: Data directories created automatically  
✅ **Template Persistence**: Templates save and load correctly  
✅ **Health Monitoring**: Storage status visible in health endpoint  
✅ **API Functionality**: All new endpoints working  
✅ **Virtual Environment**: Successfully running with webwozwenv  

## 🎯 Next Steps for Your User Study

1. **Deploy to Render** with the environment variables
2. **Test persistence** by creating a conversation and restarting the service
3. **Monitor storage** using `/health` and `/api/conversations/stats`
4. **Access data** through the API endpoints for analysis

## 📝 Example Usage During Study

```bash
# Check overall study progress
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/conversations/stats

# List all conversations
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/conversations

# Export specific conversation for analysis
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/conversations/abc12345/export > participant_1.json

# Monitor service health
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
```

Your WebWOz application is now ready for a large-scale user study with automatic, reliable data persistence! 🎉
